CS330 Assignment
This program was made using Microsoft Visual Studio Code. It requests the user to input their student ID, and then requests the user to enter a string of random numbers. If the user enters a string that contains the last 5 digits of their student ID followed by a 1, then the message "locked" will be printed out. If the user enters a string that contains the last 5 digits of their student ID followed by a 4, then the message "unlocked" will be printed out. If neither is the case, then the message "invalid" will be printed out.

After, a random string will be generated, and the student ID will be compared to it. There is a counter of the number of digits before the password which is embedded in the random string. If the ID is somehow the beginning of the random string, the number of symbols would be 0. Then, that section of the program is ran 10 times, and the minimum, maximum, and average amount of symbols is printed out.
